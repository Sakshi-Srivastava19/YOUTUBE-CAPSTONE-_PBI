🚀 Power BI Dashboard Development for YouTube Analytics 📊

As a Power BI developer, I had the opportunity to dive deep into a YouTube dataset to provide actionable insights for content creators and marketers. By analyzing key engagement metrics and video attributes, the goal was to help optimize content strategies and boost viewer engagement.

🔍 Key Highlights of the Project:

Maximized Uploads: Displayed the maximum video uploads and tracked top-performing content.
Engagement Trends: Used line charts to track upload trends and insights for videos with over 2 lakh uploads.
Visual Exploration: Utilized radar charts, bubble charts, and decomposition trees to highlight key channel metrics and category performance.
Subscriber Insights: Created a "Views per Subscriber" metric to identify how well channels are engaging their audiences.
Interactive Dashboard: Built a comprehensive and user-friendly Power BI dashboard for easy access to key analytics, helping content creators stay ahead of the curve.
The experience involved using Power BI's diverse features, including advanced DAX calculations, dynamic visualizations, and dashboard publishing to the Power BI Service.

I’m excited to continue using data-driven insights to help businesses make informed decisions and optimize digital strategies! 💡
